## v7.7.1

### Changes

- Removed `isEmpty` property from `tupleSignal`, as it may never be empty.
- Simplified JSDoc comments on some new signals.

## v7.7.0

### Additions

- `arraySignal`:
  - Added `asReadonly` method.
  -
- Created `setSignal` - a signal for handling `Set` values.
- Created `mapSignal` - a signal for handling `Map` values.
- Created `tupleSignal` - a signal for handling tuples (fixed-length arrays).
- Created `stackSignal` - an array-based signal that behaves like the stack data structure.
- Created `queueSignal` - an array-based signal that behaves like the queue data structure.
- Created `counterSignal` - a number-based signal that allows easier incrementing, decrementing, and resetting of its value.

## v7.6.1

### Additions

- `arraySignal`:
  - Added `setAt` method for setting a value at a specific index.
  - Added `updateAt` method for updating a value at a specific index.

### Bugfixes

- Export `arraySignal` from public api, as it was inaccessible.

## v7.6.0

No changes.

## v7.5.0

### Additions

- Created `arraySignal` - a signal that simplifies handling array values.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed `debouncedSignal` and `throttledSignal` update methods not working.

## v7.4.0

### Changes

- `createHttpService` now uses method overloads instead of a single method with varying options.

## v7.3.0

### Additions

- Added a new value to `ViewportRelation`: InsideButTooLarge

### Changes

- `ArdViewportObserverRef`:
  - now supports the additional `ViewportRelation` value - used when the element is both partially above and partially below the viewport.

## v7.2.2

### Fixes

- Position was supposed to return the bottom position in reference to the bottom of the viewport. It is now fixed.
- Position was also supposed to include the margins, which are now included

## v7.2.0

### Additions

- Added two new values to `ViewportRelation`: PartiallyAbove and PartiallyBelow
- `ArdiumViewportObserverService`:
  - `observeElement` now supports passing in `ElementRef`s
  - Positions are now also updated on window resize, not only on element scroll
- `ArdViewportObserverRef`:
  - added `positon` signal: returns the current position of the element in reference to the top of the viewport

### Changes

- `ArdViewportObserverRef`:
  - now supports the additional `ViewportRelation` values.
  - `isInViewport` returns true if the element is _at least partially_ inside the viewport.

## v7.1.0

### Additions

- `ArdViewportObserverRef`: added `margins` property, which contains signals returning the currently set top & bottom margin values.

## v7.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Major changes in `ArdViewportObserverRef`:
  - `viewportRelation` - changed type from `Observable<ViewportRelation>` to `Signal<ViewportRelation>`.
  - `isInViewport` - changed type from `Observable<boolean>` to `Signal<boolean | undefined>` - now when the viewport relation is `ViewportRelation.Undefined`, this returns `undefined`.
  - `enterViewport` and `leaveViewport` - removed.
- Major changes in `ArdiumViewportObserverService`:
  - `triggerRecheck()` - renamed to `recheckAll()`

### Additions

- `ArdiumViewportObserverService` now supports providing default config - added `ARD_VIEWPORT_OBSERVER_DEFAULTS` injection token and `provideViewportObserverDefaults` function for providing the default values (as well as the `ArdViewportObserverDefaults` type)
- Added `ViewportMargins` interface that represents the top & bottom margin values
- Added `ArdViewportObserverRef.recheck` that rechecks the viewport position of this specific element (before it was only possible by rechecking all registered observers)

### Internal Changes

- Refactored the entire `ArdViewportObserverRef` class
- Refactored much of the `ArdiumViewportObserverService`
- Every feature now has its exports handled by its own `index.ts` that tells what should be exported. The public api file now only exports from these `index.ts` files.

## v6.0.0

## v5.0.0

## v3.1.1

## v3.1.0

## v3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `HttpService` - replaced with `createHttpService` factory function that now takes the apiUrl and default options, and returns a class to be used as a service. Library now doesn't add the @Injectable decorator to the service - it should be handled in the application for better control.
- Removed `provideHttpService` function - not needed anymore, as factory function will now be used. The `HttpService` now no longer comes with the native `HttpClient` auto-provided.
